If you're reading this, you've probably decided to create an online course, or perhaps you already
have online course(s) and are thinking about where the best place to self-host them is. You've weighed up
the [pros and cons of selling on a marketplace](blog/online-marketplace-vs-self-hosting-courses/) and are
ready to set up your online course business.

There are a lot of options for course creators, even within the confines of the online course platform
sub-market. Some would have
you believe that they are all roughly the same, but there are crucial differences beneath the surface.
Considering that in the long-run this is a decision on how you will spend thousands of dollars in platform
fees, but also which will dictate your experience running your online course business, it's critical to
understand these subtle differences. In this article, I will examine the differences between two of the
largest players in the online course platform space: Teachable and Thinkific.

Teachable edges Thinkific in terms of marketing and complaince, but Thinkific comes out on top in

but we need to go into more detail before concluding which one is best, since it also depends on how much
you care about things like compliance and how price sensitive you are.


## Teachable vs. Thinkific: In-Depth Comparison

We will evaluate the two platforms against the following areas:

1. Pricing Plans
2. Ease of Use
3. Design and Customization
4. Compliance
5. Marketing
6. Analytics
7. Customer Support
8. Payment Options

### 1. Pricing Plans

#### Free Tier
Teachable recently removed its free pricing tier, meaning that Thinkific is the only one of the pair to offer
a free plan. The Thinkific free plan allows up to 3 courses and unlimited students, which is undeniably better
for new course creators who are unsure if their marketing efforts are going to succeed and justify the price of
higher pricing tiers.

#### Basic Tier
Outside of the free tier, the Teachable basic plan ($39/month) is $10 dollars cheaper than the Thinkific plan ($49/month)
Features within this tier are almost identical with the following key exceptions:

- Student progress tracking is available in lower plans in Thinkific, but for Teachable you need to upgrade
to the Pro ($119/month) plan for this feature
- Teachable charges 5% transaction fees on the lower tier, wheras Thinkific charges 0% transaction fees on the
lower tier

#### Pro Tier
The Thinkific Pro plan ($99/month) comes in $20 dollars cheaper than the Teachable equivalent ($119/month). With
this plan, Teachable dispenses transaction fees, making the two plans equal in that regard. Both also offer
exclusive communities for course instructors at this level.

Perhaps in response to Teachable's "coach" product, Thinkific have introduced a "Live Lessons with Zoom" feature,
though that requires a separate Zoom account, which will likely incur an additional monthly cost unless lessons
are always under the [zoom 40 minute call free tier limit](https://zoom.us/pricing).


Growth Package (although pricing a bit confusing and hoscured from pricing page).

- Advanced payment plans

*Winner*: Thinkific

### 2. Ease of Use

### For Authors
Teachable and Thinkific are bursting with features, and both do a decent job of layering the complexity.
In both cases, this takes the form of sidebars with sub-drawers:

EXAMPlE

This is quite intuitive, although I would give a slight edge to Teachable here.

For uploading videos, each platform has the concept of a video library where you can bulk import videos
to be selected. This includes integrations with:

- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive


### For Students

Both platforms generate responsive student web experiences.

Teachable has an iOS app which students can use for a [limited subset](https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001027047-Make-Your-Course-Available-on-the-iOS-App)
of the desktop site's functionality, notably:

- Pick up where they left off on another device
- Stream course videos
- View handouts, worksheets, and lecture content
- Take lecture quizzes and view their scores
- Complete lectures and sync their progress with other devices




*Winner*: Thinkific

### 3. Design and Customization

All the pages you will need for an online course are covered by both platforms' course builder functionality:
- Landing pages & sales pages
- Checkout pages
- Sign in / Sign up
- Coming soon
- Certificates (pro and up)

Thinkific and Teachable both provide access to HTML and CSS files, meaning that you can bring in someone
familiar with those technologies to fully customize the look and feel of your course website.

Thinkific comes with preconfigured templates or "themes" and a site builder where you can create and customize
your pages.

Teachable does not offer themes, and the ability to customize is not quite as granular (although this tends
to be exaggerated in most teachable vs. thinkific articles). Both platforms offer side-by-side previews of your changes next to the editing fields.

*Winner*: Thinkific

### 4. Compliance

If you are selling to customers in the EU, then you should ensure that you are charging and remitting EU VAT.
A common misconception is that this is only required if you are a business based in the EU - **this is not
the case** if you have **customers** in the EU, then you should be calculating VAT based on the location of
that particular customer.

This can be quite a headache for course creators who just want to get on with making their content. Thinkific's
answer to this has been to [partner with Quaderno](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030365534-Integrate-with-Quaderno), a compliance SaaS platoform which automates the calculation and
collection of EU VAT and integrates with payment gateways like Stripe. There is quite a landscape of SaaS payment
companies which we [cover in detail in this guide](/blog/options-saas-subscription-payment-platforms/).

Then throw in the mix US Sales Tax and the concept of [an economic nexus[](https://www.thinkific.com/blog/how-to-comply-with-us-sales-tax-online-courses/)
which has emerged after the Wayfair 2018 Supreme Court Case. Now in certain states if your sales exceed a certain
dollar amount of transaction number, you are eligible for Sales tax.

Needless to say, this is a pain that course authors don't want to have to deal with. The only way to be compliant
with Thinkific is to use Quaderno, which means that:

1) You'll have to pay Quaderno's fees (at least %49 per month), which massively increases your fixed costs
2) Even with Quaderno, you'll still have to remit the tax

On the other hand, Teachable offers "Teachable Payments" where they [take care of EU VAT](https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/223306588-VAT-on-Teachable).
However, they [do not handle US Sales tax for you](https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/231807527-US-Taxes-as-a-School-Owner-Author-or-Affiliate#:~:text=Teachable%20does%20not%20handle%20U.S.,amount%20to%20pay%20your%20taxes.)
instead offering some vague warning that:

>If you find that you need to add additional taxes for your state, you may wish to add an average tax amount to the base
>purchasing price for the course, and then save that amount to pay your taxes.
Overall, only Teachable offers any kind of built-in way of dealing the tax hassle. Thinkific relies on external
integrations which have cost implications.

*Winner*: Teachable

### 5. Marketing

Teachable has email marketing built in on all plans. On the other hand Thinkific only offers bulk email
capability on higher plans, instead offering integrations with email marketing services (MailChimp and Aweber).

In terms of affiliate marketing, both platforms offer affiliate reporting (setting up affiliate links and reports on comissions), but Thinkific
offers this on the basic plan, wheras this requires a Pro subscription to Teachable.

Teachable has a built-in blog, whereas [Thinkific does not](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030371054-Can-I-add-a-blog-on-Thinkific).
Whilst the teachable offering is hardly competitive with a mainstream blogging platform, it is servicable.

*Winner*: Teachable

### 6. Analytics

One of the key drawbacks of the Teachable basic plan is that you do not get access to "advanced reports". For this, you
need to upgrade to the pro plans. This means that you just get basic completion rates, and new student enrollments. Only
when you upgrade can you see how far students got into your course, and how far into certain lectures they got
before abandoning a lecture. If you're coming from Udemy (which offers this functionality to all authors), the
omission can come as a surprise.

On the other hand, Thinkific offers these advanced student reporting capabilities out of the box.

Both platforms offer extensive analytics integrations with 3rd party tools, with Google Analytics, and Facebook
integrated on each. Historically, Teachable has offered more integrations than Thinkific, but Thinkific has
closed the gap in this area in recent months, with both platforms offering integrations with Mixpanel,
ConvertKit and Sumo.

*Winner*: Thinkific

### 7. Customer Support

Speaking from personal experience, I can say that Teachable can definitely drop the ball when it comes to
customer support. I have been left waiting for longer than 6 weeks for a fix to a bug which left my
monthly funds transfer blocked. This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Teachable was experiencing
a higher volume of support requests than normal, but I still found it very worrying. On the other hand, for simple requests (particular those where customer
support agents can easily copy existing support links), you will get a response within 24 hours.

*Winner*: Thinkific

---
### Payment Options

Both platforms offer integrations with major third-party payment gateways, notably Stripe and PayPal to
collect your student payments. Teachable requiers you to be on the pro plan to integrate with your
Stripe account, but I do think that their fundamental "we take care of it" approach -
meaning that if you don't want to create Stripe account you can just give them a PayPal email address for
a monthly transfer - is significantly easier.

Thinkific offers payment integrations with a Shopify store, whilst Teachable allows you to achieve the
same integration using Zapier. Teachable has a slight edge in that [Google Pay and Apple Pay are supported](https://teachable.com/blog/apple-pay-google-pay-on-teachable)


#### Payment Speed
If you opt-in to use "Teachable payments" (which uses Stripe Connect under the hood), then you become
eligible for instant payouts. On the other hand, Thinkific offers instant access to your funds on all
tiers, this is simply because they only offer the ability

If you want to get paid quickly:
*Winner*: Thinkific

If you want the least hassle:
*Winner*: Teachable
