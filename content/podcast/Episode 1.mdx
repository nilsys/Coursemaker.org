### This is the Markdown content that will automatically be added to the podcast page.

Please note: The markdown file is matched with the corresponding podcast page using the episode number in the frontmatter.

The RSS feed provides this number as a string so in the frontmatter it needs to be a string as well.

So, please make sure to list the episode as "1", and not merely as 1, or else it won't show up.

Youtube videos can be embedded in markdown like this:

<YouTube youTubeId="QHjcPT-Pdoc" />

These videos are automatically wrapped in a responsive container so they work well on mobile too.

Also note that these are MDX files, which work just like normal markdown files, but can do a little bit more (but you can just use them as ordinary markdown files as well).

MDX made embedding responsive youtube videos easier.
