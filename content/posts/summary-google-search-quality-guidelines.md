## What Are the Google Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines?

> We work with external Search Quality Raters to measure the quality of search results on an ongoing basis. 
>Raters assess how well a website gives people who click on it what they are looking for, and evaluate the 
>quality of results based on the expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness of the content. These ratings 
>do not directly impact ranking, but they do help us benchmark the quality of our results and make sure that these 
>meet a high bar all around the world. 


"To ensure a consistent approach, we publish Search Quality Rater Guidelines to give these Raters guidance and 
examples for appropriate ratings."

## What Are They Looking For?

> search results should help people. Search results should provide authoritative and trustworthy information, not
lead people astray with misleading content (p.6)

> The goal of PQ [page quality] rating is to determine how well a page achieves its purpose (p.9)


## Special Categories

Some types of pages or topics could potentially impact a person’s future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.
We call such pages “Your Money or Your Life” pages, or YMYL. The following are examples of YMYL topics:
● News and current events: news about important topics such as international events, business, politics, science,
technology, etc. Keep in mind that not all news articles are necessarily considered YMYL (e.g., sports,
entertainment, and everyday lifestyle topics are generally not YMYL). Please use your judgment and knowledge
of your locale.
● Civics, government, and law: information important to maintaining an informed citizenry, such as information
about voting, government agencies, public institutions, social services, and legal issues (e.g., divorce, child
custody, adoption, creating a will, etc.).
● Finance: financial advice or information regarding investments, taxes, retirement planning, loans, banking, or
insurance, particularly webpages that allow people to make purchases or transfer money online.
● Shopping: information about or services related to research or purchase of goods/services, particularly
webpages that allow people to make purchases online.
● Health and safety: advice or information about medical issues, drugs, hospitals, emergency preparedness, how
dangerous an activity is, etc.
● Groups of people : information about or claims related to groups of people, including but not limited to those
grouped on the basis of race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation,
gender or gender identity.
● Other: there are many other topics related to big decisions or important aspects of people’s lives which thus may
be considered YMYL, such as such as fitness and nutrition, housing information, choosing a college, finding a job, etc.
Please use your judgment.

We have very high Page Quality rating standards for YMYL pages because low quality YMYL pages could potentially
negatively impact a person’s happiness, health, financial stability, or safety. (p.10)


## Main vs. Supplementary content (p.10)


## Resonsibility
Every page belongs to a website, and it should be clear:
● Who (what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) is responsible for the website.
● Who (what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) created the content on the page you are evaluating.
p.14

## special checks
The types and amount of contact information needed depend on the type of website. Contact information and customer
service information are extremely important for websites that handle money, such as stores, banks, credit card
companies, etc. Users need a way to ask questions or get help when a problem occurs.
For shopping websites, we'll ask you to do some special checks. Look for contact information—including the store’s
policies on payment, exchanges, and returns. Sometimes this information is listed under “customer service.”
p.15

## reviews
Customer reviews can be helpful for assessing the reputation of a store or business. However, you should interpret these
reviews with care, particularly if there are only a few. Be skeptical of both positive and negative user reviews. Anyone can
write them, including the creator of the website or someone the store or business hires for this purpose. See here for a
New York Times article on fake reviews and here for a Guardian article on fake reviews.
When interpreting customer reviews, try to find as many as possible. Any store or website can get a few negative
reviews. This is completely normal and expected. Large stores and companies have thousands of reviews and most
receive some negative ones.
It is also important to read the reviews because the content of the reviews matter, not just the number. Credible,
convincing reports of fraud and financial wrongdoing is evidence of extremely negative reputation. A single encounter
with a rude clerk or the delayed receipt of a single package should not be considered negative reputation information.
Please use your judgment.
p.16


## supporting evidence
Look for articles, reviews, forum posts, discussions, etc. written by people about the website. For businesses,
there are many sources of reputation information and reviews. Here are some examples: Yelp , Better Business
Bureau (a nonprofit organization that focuses on the trustworthiness of businesses and charities), Amazon , and
Google Shopping . You can try searching on specific sites to find reviews. For example, you can try [ibm
site:bbb.org] or [“ibm.com” site:bbb.org].
p.17

## rating
At a high level, here are the steps of Page Quality rating:
1. Understand the true purpose of the page. Websites or pages without any beneficial purpose, including pages that
are created with no attempt to help users, or pages that potentially spread hate, cause harm, or misinform or
deceive users, should receive the Lowest rating. No further assessment is necessary.
2. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose using the criteria outlined in the
following sections on Lowest , Low , Medium , High, and Highest quality pages.
On Page Quality rating tasks, you will use the Page Quality sliding scale (slider) to assign the overall PQ rating. The
slider looks like this:
You may also use the in-between ratings of Lowest+ , Low+ , Medium+ , and High+ . Please interpret the “+” as “+ ½,”
meaning that the Lowest+ rating is halfway between Lowest and Low , Low+ is halfway between Low and Medium , etc.
In the following sections, you will learn about characteristics of Lowest , Low , Medium , High, and Highest quality pages.

## most important factors
Here are the most important factors to consider when selecting an overall Page Quality rating:
● The Purpose of the Page
● Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness: This is an important quality characteristic. Use your research
on the additional factors below to inform your rating.
● Main Content Quality and Amount: The rating should be based on the landing page of the task URL.
● Website Information/information about who is responsible for the MC: Find information about the website as
well as the creator of the MC.
● Website Reputation/reputation about who is responsible for the MC : Links to help with reputation research
will be provided.
