At this point, course creation is complete and you're thinking about how to avoid the number one risk 
when it comes to creating an online course: **Not getting sales**

![online course sales always be closing](/assets/how_to_sell/always_be_closing.jpg)

The science of ensuring that you can sell online courses falls into two broad areas which we will cover in detail:

### 1. Your Course Site
### 2. Online Course Business Marketing/Sales Strategy & Tactics

---
## Your Online Course Website

### Your Copy
When you sell a course in the online learning industry, you are selling the idea of a transformation. Your student will
take your course and emerge at the end with a new skill, mindset, understanding, or motivation which
will have a noteworthy impact on their life. It is important to understand:

#### 1) Who your student is - what are their motivations and goals?
#### 2) What exact transformation you are offering through your course?

Once you have these two points figured out, then they should inform your copy - both in terms of tone
and messaging. Consistency is key here - if you start mixing analogies, or emphasizing quite different
benefits, then you will confuse potential students.

*Virgin Atlantic's copy has always been edgy and tongue in cheek. This is unlikely to work for your
online course brand, but gives you an idea of the sheer range of possibilities when it comes to tone.*

### Your Pricing

> Pricing is part of your product

You should consider your business model carefully, especially for a new course - are you offering a one-time 
purchase model or going for a membership site? This can have significant pricing implications. When setting your 
price, you are also sending a signal. A low price indicates that what you are
selling is of low value. Excessive discounts can make potential students suspicious and alienate
existing students. Act accordingly. 

### Your Sales Page
A sales page, also known as a landing page, is where potential customers become actual customers.
This is the point from which you sell your online course. Naturally, this page needs to be clear. 
It's useful to think of this page as a conversation with
your customer. What questions will they have? What objections might they throw out? You should 
look to answer and reassure on your landing page. Here's a formula:

- Show you understand the student's problem (e.g. "I don't know technology X which means I am
less likely to get a great job"). Highlight the pain points.
- Show that you are the guide to help them address this problem through a combination of empathy
and demonstrations of your authority and expertise in this area
- Show you have a plan - a clear process for their transformation, and an agreement on what specifics
you will teach in your course (i.e. your curriculum). This should include things like the learning
outcomes.
- Show you understand what success looks like for your potential student and how you will help
them avoid failure
- Have a clear call to action

### Content Mix
Having engaging content on your course website both before and after a student signs up is another
important way to improve your course sales. You don't just want walls of text but also images, 
quotes, gifs, bullet points, and videos.

Great ways to show authority include customer testimonials, trust pilot reviews, and social share
stats. These can also create visually appealing "pops" on your landing page. It's also useful
to have "about the author" course pages or landing page sections where you detail your course author(s) backgrounds - humanize
yourself with a photo (or better yet, video), and add plenty of detail. Students want to know
who they are learning from!

## Marketing & Sales Tactics

### Growing Your Audience
If you are serious about making a good living from your online courses, building an
audience is the logical place to put your effort. This also has the added benefit of 
[improving your personal branding](/blog/improve-personal-branding-software-developers/), as well
as setting your online business up for the long-term.

> Audience is the new currency

The days of "build it and they will come" are gone. To be honest, those days never existed.
There are plenty of approaches to generate traffic if you don't have an audience already which we
discuss below,
but they tend to involve spending money (e.g. through ads). A more sustainable approach is to
really double down on audience building as [described in this podcast with Anthony "pomp" Pomliano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDefPe9AhHQ).

![target audience](/assets/how_to_sell/target_audience.png)


### Tactics List
Here is the complete sales & marketing tactics list for course creators. We will go step-by-step through
each of them below. These are derived
from the [excellent book Traction](https://www.goodreads.com/id/book/show/23110525-traction). The
key principle to understand here is that some of these approaches will work for you and some will not.
It depends a lot on your natural talents e.g. are you a good writer or presenter, do you have 
an analytical mind for running ad campaigns, are you a natural extravert good at building connections,
do you have a knack for sales. You may already have a strong understanding of some of these channels.
Nonetheless, it is worth trying those options that you wouldn't normally consider so that you can find the traction 
approach which suits your course audience best. Just don't try them all at once!

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO is the process of improving your ranking in Google (and other search engine) results, or Search
Engine Result Pages (SERPs). This allows you to build on value you might be creating via other
tactics, such as content marketing or publicity. For this reason, your SEO and your
content marketing (which we will discuss next) should be carefully aligned. This is a cornerstone of digital marketing.  

There are two key areas to consider with SEO:
1) On-page SEO - this is ensuring that your page structure is easy to crawl (ensuring that your
page titles, h1 tags, and meta tags are all in place) and that the content on your blog is structured
around topics your target audience are likely to search for and derive value from.

2) Off-page SEO. This basically comes down to other sites linking to yours. This is one of the key
ways search engines decide that your site is an "authority" on a topic, kind of like an upvote 
system.

SEO is a big old topic, but if you can arm yourself with a basic understanding of it, you will
spin your wheels far less when it comes to content marketing.

### Content Marketing

Sometimes this tactic can feel overwhelming. Just remember, it's fundamentally about creating value
for current and potential users. That's it. 

Then there are the nitty-gritty details, things like:

- The sort of content you are going to publish - blogging pithy listicles or detailed guides, TikTok dances,
Twitch live streams, webinars, youtube videos - there are many forms of content. Experiment.
- The tone of your content - formal vs. informal, beginner-focused vs. advanced, technical vs. non-technical
- Your positioning - linked to your tone, are you a scrappy one person band taking on the 
establishment or perhaps targeting specific sub-culture.

These will all form your brand, and your content should reinforce this in a predictable cycle. 
This way your audience comes to trust you and know what to expect from you, as a result, they will 
be much more likely to buy from you.

Consistency is key with content marketing. This blog is a form of content marketing. Notice
that the posts are regular - this is not a coincidence.

### Email Marketing

Rumors of the death of email are greatly exaggerated. Email lists are still king. 

>Email marketing can be used for all stages of the customer life cycle: building familiarity with prospects, 
>acquiring customers, and retaining the customers you already have.


*Traction*

When you combine SEO, content marketing and email marketing, you can create a very powerful combination.
If you offer users access to valuable content via a mailing list or newsletter they can subscribe
to, you can build a following over time. The newsletter is a tried and tested way to build up
a loyal audience, but its model is still constantly being iterated on, and paid newsletters as an
actual business rather than just as a [lead is becoming more common](https://trends.vc/trends-0011-paid-newsletters/).

![email marketing](/assets/how_to_sell/email_marketing.png)

#### Lead Magnets
A common practice for email marketing is to have a "lead magnet", which is a flagship piece of content
you offer potential students in exchange for their email address. This could be a pdf ebook, access to
an exclusive course or slack channel, or worksheets.

When it comes to online courses, having an email list is a very powerful lever that allows you to
run presales campaigns, get beta testers, check ideas, and run seasonal sales. 

![lead magnet example](/assets/how_to_sell/lazy_programmer_lead_magnet.png)
*Lazy Programmer offers an [entire course as free content](https://lazyprogrammer.me/deep-learning-courses/) (i.e. a lead magnet) - 
this is obviously a very advanced technique*

### Podcasting
It's never been easier to create a podcast. In a way, this is an advanced form of content marketing.
But don't think you necessarily have to create the podcast, appearing as a guest on podcasts
can also be a great way to connect with your course's potential audience.


### Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

SEM, or search engine marketing, is using paid advertising to ensure that your course
is visible in search engine results pages (SERPs)

If you know what you are doing, or are prepared to put in the work learning how to create effective
Google ads, then this channel can be a way to generate course sales when you have no existing
audience.

### Social & Display Ads
Many social platforms will allow you to target potential course students with ads very effectively.
Whilst Instagram and Facebook ads may be expensive and over-utilized, they can work given enough time
and research (facebook groups can be particularly effective). 
Less popular platforms for ads, such as Reddit, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and twitter can
all offer decent click through rates. Like SEM, this is another way to drum up traffic if you 
are starting from zero and have a little money to spend.

### Social Media & Word of Mouth
Not all social media is for everyone. I can't stand Facebook, but I'm a bit partial to LinkedIn. Play
around with the options out there, find the place that you feel more natural operating in, and then
grow your presence. Wrote a cool post? Create a useful snippet you can post in multiple social media
channels. 

Leverage your existing contacts, professional and personal. If you have people in your circle who
have audiences who would be interested in your course content, ask them to help you spread the word!

Finally, nothing beats word of mouth. If you have students who promote your content of their own
volition this can be extremely powerful. Note, this is a great reason to offer completion certificates
to your courses, as they are the sort of thing that students share on sites like LinkedIn. This is 
something Udemy is good at.

### Engineering as Marketing (AKA growth hacking)
If you are technical or are willing to pay/beg for technical assistance, then creating products
that your potential students would find valuable and seek out can be a great growth hack. 

Here's how Netlify do this with their [open-source HeadlessCMS comparison site](https://headlesscms.org/)

### Direct Sales
This is just good old cold outreach. Email people. Use LinkedIn paid "InMail". Pick up the phone. 
It's brutal, but it works. Be sure to follow up with anyone who replies! This can be particularly effective for 
courses with a high price point. It is also
effective for a course topic that centers around a compliance requirement.

### Targeting blogs
This is asking other people who already have an audience to talk about your online course. This is 
likely someone who is an influencer in your course's niche. Offer to pay them! Or give them free
access and ask for a review. Comment on their content and build rapport. A single post or mention
from someone who is big in your niche can really move the needle for your sales.

### Publicity 
Publicity is about getting featured on major news sites. This can serve a double purpose of adding
authority and credibility to your online course. There's no magic formula to getting featured on these
sites, but a key thing to do is make sure you are posting your content in places like Hacker News
and Product Hunt, which journalists from news sites like [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) monitor
for things that might be work picking up.

### Offline Ads

Radio, TV, billboards...these are all still options! It seems so antiquated now that it might
actually be worth giving a shot since it will be so unusual. 

### Affiliate Programs
Affiliate marketing is when you promote other companies’ products. You can allow affiliates to
promote your online course and then offer them a commission in the event of a sale.

Many online course platforms (Thinkific, Teachable, CourseMaker) will allow you to set up affiliate links. You can
then reach out to influencers in your niche and see if they are interested in being an affiliate. 

It's a deep rabbit hole, but some people have made a lot of money going down this path.

###n Offline Events & Conferences

In 2020 in-person meetups have obviously taken a hit due to COVID-19, but events are still happening
virtually. In many ways, now is a far less intimidating time to volunteer to do a talk since it
will probably be via Zoom! Start with small events and then gradually work your way up. If you 
have a colleague who has done a talk before, ask them to recommend you or do a joint talk (this is
what I did). This can be a great way to raise awareness about your online course, and also improve
your credentials (which you can use in your sales copy).

### Thinking in Terms of Sales Funnels

We've just been through a long list of tactics. The secret is to combine and chain these into
effective sales funnels. 

![Sales Funnel](/assets/how_to_sell/sales_funnel.jpg)
*Source: [entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296526)*

This is the classic "AIDA" formula (Awareness, Interest, Decision, Action). Potential students
may not hear about your course launch immediately, your course sales page may not have a great
conversion rate - but if you are collecting email addresses, your brand is appearing on multiple
platforms, then you will be able to move more potential students down the funnel. You can also run
marketing campaigns to drive extra traffic through a given sales funnel, and also to experiment with 
variations. Sales funnel experimentation is particularly important when you are selling via
your [own website, rather than on a marketplace](/blog/online-marketplace-vs-self-hosting-courses/).

This is not something "slimy" or "sleazy" that you should feel bad about. You have worked hard
to build an online course that will add value to people's lives - **help them find it!**

Good luck and always be closing ;)
