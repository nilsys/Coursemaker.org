Every Udemy course instructor who has been on the platform for more than a few months has had that
sinking feeling - You know the one: looking at how much you are earning per student and realize that 
it's...**a tiny fraction of the course price on average**:

![udemy price share](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/udemy_share.png "ouch")

**Seeing these kinds of numbers feels like a punch in the gut.** 
You put all those hours into your course and that's all the cut you get? 

Having said that, there's no denying that Udemy's status as an elearning marketplace offers 
value to course instructors and a convenient learning experience for students.
There are millions of students on Udemy. Having
access to a large pool of students can free up instructors from a lot of marketing work which
can leave many instructors feeling like they have no choice but to stick to Udemy.

The good news is that there are many alternative marketplaces where you can sell your courses. In
some cases, these can be **in addition** to or **instead of** Udemy. In this post, I will
explain step-by-step the pros and cons to key online course marketplace alternatives.

## Udemy Alternatives - Marketplaces

There are hundreds of e-learning sites out there, and Udemy is clearly the king with
some [50 million students as of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udemy).
Here we will talk about five significant Udemy alternatives for course authors.

![Udemy alternative chart](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/alternative_chart.png)

### 1. Skillshare
![skillshare homepage](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/skillshare_homepage.png)

**Alexa Global Traffic Rank**: ~1,600

Skillshare is the largest Udemy alternative but has some important differences.

In 2018, when the platform closed its 28 million series C round of funding, [it had
over 5 million users](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skillshare-announces-28-million-series-c-funding-300685363.html)

In 2019, during a [Yahoo Finance interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/skillshare-ceo-e-learning-space-135904232.html),
the Skillshare CEO Matt Cooper said the platform had

> 8 thousands teachers [...] and about 26000 classes

He also noted in the same interview that:

> Skillshare does not cover coding [...] it's not our core competence

Skillshare focuses more on creative (but still practical) skills such as design, drawing,
painting, photography, marketing, and animation. There is also a strong set of business
courses. Crucially, Skillshare courses tend to be relatively
short. This is likely to be due to the subscription business model (so students aren't
gauging their "bang for the buck" on course length like they are on a site like Udemy). It does
have some knock-on effects though since it means Skillshare courses tend to go into less
depth than some of their longer Udemy equivalents.

#### Skillshare Course Instructor Payments
Skillshare costs students $15 per month for a subscription (or $99 billed annually).
The consequence of the subscription business model for instructors is that they earn
revenue through royalty payments. This means that teachers will receive payment based
on the number of minutes of their class watched by Skillshare's paying students.

>Each month, 30% of Skillshare’s total Premium Membership revenue goes to a royalty pool
for teachers. [...] Teachers are paid from the royalty pool based on their share of the
minutes watched by Premium students (both paying members and those in free trials)
across the platform each month

*Source*: [Skillshare teacher's handbook](https://help.skillshare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205222697-Earning-Royalties-)

What appeals to me about this business model is that teachers are rewarded for creating
materials that keep students engaged.

Due to its subscription model, instructors used to Udemy's marketing tools (such as coupons) may
find themselves feeling more limited, Skillshare offers $10 for every new student who signs up through
your [referral link](https://help.skillshare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205222467-How-do-I-use-my-class-referral-link-).


## 2. Skillwise

![skillwise homepage](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/skillwise_homepage.png)

**Alexa Traffic Rank**: ~15000 (average across partner sites)

[Skillwise](https://skillwise.com) is part of the [Stack Commerce](https://www.stackcommerce.com/about/) 
umbrella. It is not to be confused with the BBC's skillwise website.

Confusingly you apply to be an instructor via the 
[Stack Commerce form](https://www.stackcommerce.com/vendors/)

To become a course author you simply apply, there are limited barriers to entry.
Skillwise boasts >600,000 students on its platform.

One important point to note, however, is that the course content on the platform is 
limited to the following broad areas:

- Software Development
- Design
- IT + Security
- Business
- Photography


#### Skillwise Instructor Payments

For courses sold organically on StackCommerce sites (such as Skillwise, 
[stackskills](https://stackskills.com/courses), and [stacksocial](https://stacksocial.com)) 
then you get 50%:
As per the [instructor terms and conditions](https://stackcommerce.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031423631-Instructor-Terms-Conditions)
> Instructors will earn an Instructor Revenue Share for any Course sold on StackCommerce's 
> Direct Sites of fifty percent (50%)

For sites sold through "partner" sites, you get 20%:
> When a Partner Site sells Your Course, Your Instructor Revenue Share will be adjusted to twenty percent 
> (20%) of the Net Sale Amount

And similar to Udemy (although actually worse for instructors), if a course is sold as a result
of paid ads (e.g. Google AdWords / Facebook Ads) then they take a whopping 90%:
>  "Paid Advertising." Instructor Revenue Share will be adjusted to ten percent (10%)


### 3. Edureka
![Edureka homepage](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/edureka_homepage.png)

**Alex Global Traffic Ranking**: ~3,200

Edureka has rapidly grown in recent years. Whilst it still has more than 50% of its traffic
from India, it is growing internationally.

Becoming an instructor involves [filling in a form](https://www.edureka.co/instructors/add) 
and then undergoing training based on
"Edureka's Learning Methodology"

> Anyone who has an in-depth working knowledge of the particular domain and is very passionate 
>about teaching and sharing his/her expert knowledge with students and professionals can 
>teach at Edureka. Good oral communication skills are mandatory.

The model of delivery for Edureka is a little different from the other marketplaces here, as students
have the option to go into timed cohorts (similar to online classes or training courses). The idea is that
Edureka puts students into these batches in order to improve the usually pretty-poor online course 
completion rates.

#### Edureka Instructor Payments
Edureka negotiates separate payment agreements with different course instructors which may work
for or against you depending on factors such as your experience, location, and reputation.


### 4. Skills Success
![Skills Success homepage](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/skills_success_homepage.png)

**Alexa Global Traffic Ranking**: 81,935
Course creators might also want to consider [Skills Success](https://www.skillsuccess.com/)

The process here is to provide a link to the course (easy to do if you're already on Udemy,
for new authors I guess you provide a link to the videos). They then get back to you
within 3 days. 

### 5. Coggno
![coggno homepage](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/coggno_homepage.png)
**Alexa Global Traffic Rank**: ~660,000

Despite the website's shockingly bad UI, this is actually quite
a successful marketplace! It is alleged that some 2 million students are on 
the Coggno platform,
although the site's low Alexa rank does cast some doubt on this figure.

Unlike the other marketplaces, Coggno is also an LMS. This means that it is a hybrid product
where you can use it for internal training purposes or setup courses on their marketplace.

Coggno benefits include:
- Rich all-in-one feature-set (since it is fundamentally an elearning LMS), including landing
page customization, progress monitoring, and certification
- [SCORM compliant](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/)
- You simultaneously get your own website and an entry on the Coggno marketplace

#### Coggno Instructor Payments

- Instructors pay $35/month for the LMS
- For sales on the instructor website, instructors receive 80%-92% profits
- For sales on the Coggno marketplace, instructors receive 60% of the profits


### Honorable Mentions
A few online course marketplaces to consider that don't quite have the volume to make the top 4 yet, but
which might still be worth checking out:

- [Curious](https://curious.com/teach#howitworks)
- [TabletWise](https://www.tabletwise.com/)

## Niche Marketplaces

For those with specific skills, it might also be worth looking at these niche sites:

*Coding*
- [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)
- [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) note that they are a little different
in that [employees create their courses](https://www.codecademy.com/about/job?gh_jid=4792721002)

*Marketing*
[CXL Institute](https://cxl.com/)

*Design*
[Phlearn](https://phlearn.com/)
[Creative Live](https://www.creativelive.com/)

*Compliance*
[360 Training](https://www.360training.com/)

### Prestigious Marketplaces (e.g. Coursera)
Note that so far I've deliberately not mentioned some of the big names you might already be familiar
with such as Coursera or Khan Academy. This is because many of these have Udemy alternatives
have a barrier to entry that many Udemy instructors will not be able to meet:

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): Requires you to be an instructor at a world-class university. Typically, 
there are free courses with the ability to "audit" them for a fee.
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/instructors/build-with-udacity): Requires a detailed application, 5+ years of experience, and
commitment to 15-20 hours per week. You need to ensure you are applying to teach a [subject of interest](https://www.udacity.com/instructors/subjects-of-interest)
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/teach) (formerly Lynda.com) requires "short audition video" and
generally is quite selective, although if you are knowledgable about a
particular technical niche you should give it a shot.
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/instructors)
- [Learning.ly](https://learning.ly/pages/expert) - similar to Pluralsight, these guys expect at
least one of the following (1) Field experience (2) Awards or distinctions or (3) Track record
of presenting at important industry events

Note that if you do qualify for any of the above, and are able to meet the high quality
bar that most of them set, they can be a great option. 

To give you a feel for their size:
- Pluralsight has [6500+ courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralsight)
- LinkedIn Learning: With more than [5,000 courses](https://www.linkedin.com/help/learning/answer/71918/linkedin-learning-overview)

These online learning platforms do tend to pay authors more (although this is subject to 
factors such as the amount of time students spend on an author's course)

## Understanding Udemy Terms and Conditions

A common question from Udemy instructors looking around at alternatives is "Am I allowed 
to put my course on another marketplace?" The answer is **yes**, as you can see from this
[support answer](
https://community.udemy.com/t5/First-time-Course-Creation/Can-I-sell-my-course-to-another-platform/td-p/51134)

> Udemy's marketplace model means that when you publish a course on our platform, you retain all the rights to your content

Note that this is a little different if your course is part of the more selective ["Udemy for Business"](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013221767-How-do-I-Earn-Revenue-From-Udemy-for-Business-)
program. If this is the case, then if you want to sell your course on another marketplace you
need to "terminate your participation in the Udemy for Business Program" (which you can do at
any time). The key thing to note is that the terms and conditions say:

> Udemy will remove your courses from the Collection within 12 months of termination

Which is deliberately vague. In theory, this means that you are obliged not to sell your course
on another marketplace for up to 12 months, depending on how long Udemy takes to withdraw the
course.

Crucially, for Udemy for Business authors, there are no restrictions on selling on your own platform.

In [section 2.4 of the Udemy Promotions Policy](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013339928)
it states:

> Once your course is included in the Collection, you agree that you will not begin to offer any pre-recorded courses 
that directly compete with or injure the sales of that course on any site or platform other than your own

Note the qualification "any site or platform [...] other than your own"
This does give you the flexibility to offer your course on your own platform.

Here is a summary of your options:

![Udemy instructor alternative options](/assets/udemy_alt_marketplaces/instructor_options.png)

Naturally, if you opt to sell your course on alternative platforms you need to manage your
pricing accordingly: Students will not be delighted to discover they could have got your course
cheaper on a different marketplace - these are the unwritten rules of ecommerce.

## Sell on your own site vs. another marketplace

![Pros and cons of online course marketplaces](/assets/choosing_platform/pros_cons_cat.jpg "pros and cons cat")

Broadly speaking, there are two main types of online learning platforms:

- Other marketplaces (what we have discussed so far)
- Self-hosted sites

A Google search will reveal many options for online course self-hosting such as:

- Teachable
- Thinkific
- Kajabi
- Podia
- CourseMaker
- Various open-source LMS projects and WordPress plugins

With any of these online course builder options, there are a lot of new things to consider:
- transaction & hosting fees 
- membership sites
- setting up payments (e.g. with Stripe or Paypal)
- optimizing sales pages 
- running webinars
- marketing - particularly content and email marketing as well as social media

In short, you have to "go it alone". Whilst taking this path to sell online courses means the burden
of the marketing falls on you, this can be a really powerful way to take full control of your online course
business and course creation process.

We have detailed posts explaining:
- How to choose whether or not to [use an online course platform or go with a marketplace](/blog/online-marketplace-vs-self-hosting-courses/)
- Your [options for self-hosting](/blog/sell-online-course-your-own-website/)


<a name="evaluation"></a>

## Which Marketplace Is Right For You?

If you have 5+ years of relevant industry experience and/or a track record in an in-demand
field, it might be worth giving the more selective platforms (Pluralsight, Udacity, 
Linkedin Learning) a shot. For those working in universities, Coursera or EdX might be an 
option.

For course creators looking to easily replicate existing Udemy success, the best 
alternative place to sell courses is Skillshare, with Edureka and Skillwise also worthy 
of consideration. If you're in a more niche field, or you worry that the existing 
competition is too entrenched, some of the smaller players listed above might be better
options.

If you are more entrepreneurial, then [setting up your own course website](/blog/sell-online-course-your-own-website/)
could be your best bet.

Wishing you success!
