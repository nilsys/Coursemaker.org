title: Teachable vs. Thinkific - An In-Depth Comparison
---
<header class="header"></header>
If you're reading this, you've probably decided to create an online course, or perhaps you already
have online course(s) and are thinking about where the best place to self-host them is. You've weighed up
the pros and cons of selling on a marketplace.

There are a lot of options even within the confines of hte online course platform sub-market. Some would have
you believe that they are all roughly the same, but there are crucial differences beneath the surface. Considering
that in the long-run this is a decision on how you will spend thousands of dollars in platform fees, but also which
will dictate your experience running your online course business, it's critical to understand these subtle differences.
Here we
examine those details between two of the largest players in the online course platform space: Teachable and
Thinkific.

but we need to go into more detail before concluding which one is best, since it also depends on how much
you care about things like compliance and how price sensitive you are.


## Teachable vs. Thinkific: In-Depth Comparison

We will evaluate the two platforms against the following areas:

1. Pricing Plans
2. Ease of Use
3. Design and Customization
3. Compliance
4. Marketing
5. Analytics
6. Customer Support
7. Payment Options

### Pricing Plans

#### Free Tier
Teachable recently removed its free pricing tier, meaning that Thinkific is the only one of the pair to offer
a free plan. The Thinkific free plan allows up to 3 courses and unlimited students, which is undeniably better
for new course creators who are unsure if their marketing efforts are going to succeed and justify the price of
higher pricing tiers.

#### Basic Tier
Outside of the free tier, the Teachable basic plan ($39/month) is $10 dollars cheaper than the Thinkific plan ($49/month)
Features within this tier are almost identical with the following key exceptions:

- Student progress tracking is available in lower plans in Thinkific, but for Teachable you need to upgrade
to the Pro ($119/month) plan for this feature
- Teachable charges 5% transaction fees on the lower tier, wheras Thinkific charges 0% transaction fees on the
lower tier

#### Pro Tier
The Thinkific Pro plan ($99/month) comes in $20 dollars cheaper than the Teachable equivalent ($119/month). With
this plan, Teachable dispenses transaction fees, making the two plans equal in that regard. Both also offer
exclusive communities for course instructors at this level.

Perhaps in response to Teachable's "coach" product, Thinkific have introduced a "Live Lessons with Zoom" feature,
though that requires a separate Zoom account, which will likely incur an additional monthly cost unless lessons
are always under the [zoom 40 minute call free tier limit](https://zoom.us/pricing).


Growth Package (although pricing a bit confusing and hoscured from pricing page).

### Ease of Use


*Winner*: Thinkific


### Design and Customization
Thinkific and Teachable both provide access to HTML and CSS files, meaning that you can bring in someone
familiar with those technologies to fully customize the look and feel of your course website.

Thinkific comes with preconfigured templates

### Compliance

If you are selling to customers in the EU, then you should ensure that you are charging and remitting EU VAT.
A common misconception is that this is only required if you are a business based in the EU - **this is not
the case** if you have **customers** in the EU, then you should be calculating VAT based on the location of
that particular customer.

This can be quite a headache for course creators who just want to get on with making their content. Thinkific's
answer to this has been to [partner with Quaderno](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030365534-Integrate-with-Quaderno), a compliance SaaS platoform which automates the calculation and
collection of EU VAT and integrates with payment gateways like Stripe. There is quite a landscape of SaaS payment
companies which we [cover in detail in this guide](/blog/options-saas-subscription-payment-platforms/).

Then throw in the mix US Sales Tax and the concept of [an economic nexus[](https://www.thinkific.com/blog/how-to-comply-with-us-sales-tax-online-courses/)
which has emerged after the Wayfair 2018 Supreme Court Case. Now in certain states if your sales exceed a certain
dollar amount of transaction number, you are eligible for Sales tax.

Needless to say, this is a pain that course authors don't want to have to deal with. The only way to be compliant
with Thinkific is to use Quaderno, which means that:

1) You'll have to pay Quaderno's fees (at least %49 per month), which massively increases your fixed costs
2) Even with Quaderno, you'll still have to remit the tax

On the other hand, Teachable offers "Teachable Payments" where they [take care of EU VAT](https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/223306588-VAT-on-Teachable).
However, they [do not
handle US Sales tax for you](https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/231807527-US-Taxes-as-a-School-Owner-Author-or-Affiliate#:~:text=Teachable%20does%20not%20handle%20U.S.,amount%20to%20pay%20your%20taxes.)
instead offering some vague warning that:

>If you find that you need to add additional taxes for your state, you may wish to add an average tax amount to the base
>purchasing price for the course, and then save that amount to pay your taxes.

Overall, only Teachable offers any kind of built-in way of dealing the tax hassle. Thinkific relies on external
integrations which have cost implications.

*Winner*: Teachable

### Customer Support

Speaking from personal experience, I can say that Teachable can definitely drop the ball when it comes to
customer support. I have been left waiting for longer than 6 weeks for a fix to a bug which left my
monthly funds transfer blocked. This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Teachable was experiencing
a higher volume of support requests than normal, but I still found it very worrying. On the other hand, for simple requests (particular those where customer
support agents can easily copy existing support links), you will get a response within 24 hours.
